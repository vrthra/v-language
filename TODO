* use haskellish io (gets!, puts! with anything containing it restricted to use a name ending with !)

* Integrate green-threads branch (trampolined threads)
* Expose continuations
* Redo exception-handling using continuations

* Single assignment predeclared bindings (Oz style) rather than current &parent style
* or use quotes only as a namespace with all things bound separately from the invoking of it
    i.e [A [B _]. _]. B should be bound during the binding of A and not during invocation of A
    thus disallowing variables.
* Linda style messaging (implement remote calls)

* match using same syntax as current view but producing boolean
* Implement tiny-clos style MOP
* implement better GC for native V
